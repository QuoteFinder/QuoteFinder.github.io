# [QuoteFinder][QuoteFinder]

This was made to find when a quote occurs among a tv show. Originally made because I was excited for Psych 2: Lassie Come Home coming out but then I ended up adding a couple of my other favorite shows that I used to watch.
Available TV Shows to look through:
1) Psych
2) Monk
3) The Mentalist
4) White Collar
5) Leverage

Known Issue: The CSV Files being used are not properly cleaned so you may see captioning credits during some searches.
